Attention! The project is still in development. There may be unfinished parts and multiple bugs.


Brief description of the project:
This is a multifunctional solution for online businesses and personal brands that can facilitate communication with clients and promote their product to the masses - a Telegram bot that includes the following functions:
1. Menu with a choice of the necessary items in the keyboard
2. The ability to check the subscription to the Telegram channel before opening the full functionality of the bot
3. Sending messages on behalf of the team
4. Signing up for consultations
5. Distribution of free goods and gifts from the brand
And much more! You can see the full functionality in this repository.
Important! To check the subscription to the Telegram channel, the bot must be its administrator!


The "media" folder is not included in the repository (see .gitignore), but it is required for running. 
For correct "out-of-the-box" operation, the media folder must contain files of the following formats:
